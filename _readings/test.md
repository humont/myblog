Calculus, economics, politics, and history - when you take these and pepper in love, war, pirates, and the discovery of the world, you end up with Stephenson's "The Confusion".

Set in a slightly 'altered' historical reality of the 17th century, This book manages to combine dry wit (I chuckled frequently, and burst out laughing at least twice) with discussions of natural philosophy, calculus, politics, economics, and hints as to the beginning of the digital age.

The book is broken into two volumes, which are 'con-fused' together in alternating chapters. One, the Juncto, follows the development of politics, economics, and philosophy whilst continuing to follow the life of Eliza, Daniel Waterhouse, Issac Newton and more of the great characters from the first book (Quicksilver). I was taken from the streets of London, to Versailles in France, and followed the evil machinations of devious characters such as Father Gex, and the duc d'Arcachon. 

The other volume, Bonanza, follows Jack Shaftoe in his adventures through out the world. The grandioseness of his adventure can't really be emphasised enough. From galley slave, to king of an Indian province, then leader of a magnificent transcontinental ship, and subject to torture by the Spanish Inquisition, Jack sees it all in his drive to go back to his home of London and his love Eliza.

Stephenson does not skirt over anything, and provides rich details as to the era and its politics. Describing clothes, customs, mannerisms, I was truly immersed in the experience.

But this depth came at a cost, and I found myself losing focus on the book in many parts, unable to make myself interested in the finer minutia of 17th century life.

Luckily, these sections don't drag on too long, and are quickly replaced with fascinating discussions of philosophy, maths, and economics, and the wild adventures of Jack and his cabal.

I give it a 12 - not a *must* read, but I would recommend it to fans of historical fiction.

I'll defiantly be reading the third instalment.
