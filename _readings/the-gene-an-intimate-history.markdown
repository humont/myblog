From Aristotle to recent Chinese modifications of human embryo's, observational and scientific notions of inheriting phenotypes from our parents has shaped history in dramatic, though often unappreciated, ways. This is a book that tells the tale of the gene's influence on humanity and society through history.

Before I begin, it is worth noting that genomic and epigenetic science is on the verge of on an explosion in importance. China has broken the unofficial global moratorium on the genetic modification of human embryos, and done just that: [modified the genes of embryos in an attempt to make them HIV resistant](https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/11/11405626/human-gene-editing-embryos-china-hiv-resistance). 

Mukherjee's book gives me the historical background necessary to understand the changes occurring the scientific and soon, political world. It warns of the dangers of ignoring the significance of these scientific breakthroughs, but also builds up excitement and anticipation for the medical breakthroughs which are *just* around the corner.
