From Aristotle to recent Chinese modifications of human embryo's, observational and scientific notions of inheriting phenotypes from our parents has shaped history in dramatic, though often unappreciated, ways. This is a book that tells the tale of the gene's influence on humanity and society through history.

Before I begin, it is worth noting that genomic and epigenetic science is on the verge of on an explosion in importance. China has broken the unofficial global moratorium on the genetic modification of human embryos, and done just that: [modified the genes of embryos in an attempt to make them HIV resistant](https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/11/11405626/human-gene-editing-embryos-china-hiv-resistance). 

Mukherjee's book gives me the historical background necessary to understand the changes occurring in the scientific, and soon political world. It warns of the dangers of ignoring and not preparing for the significance of these scientific breakthroughs, but also builds up excitement and anticipation for the medical implications which are *just* around the corner.

## Part One: The "Missing Science of Heredity"
### The Discovery and Rediscovery of Genes (1865 -1935)

It begins with Mendel attending a lecture by Doppler in 1845, and marvelling at the scientific soundness of physics. This in turn became a frustration at the field of biology - always concerned with its taxonomies and classifications - and its lack of questions. The superficial semblance of order offered by classification failed to answer the big *why* questions.

*why* are animals classified as they are? *why* do they remain constant in their classification (why don't elephants morph into giraffes)?

> "Why did like beget like?

This question has been asked for a long time.
* Pythagoras proposed that hereditary information was stored in the man's semen. Semen went through the man's body, collecting information, and then passing it on to the woman, who nurtured the semen in her womb and grew it into a baby.
..* A clear partitioning of roles between man and woman: the man provides the information, the raw material, the creative essence. The woman nurtures and cares - an incubator.
..* this makes the child purely the man's. All the woman did was provide food. 
..* the man was nature, the women was nurture.

* Plato took this further (in *Republic*): If a child was a mathematical derivative of man and women, the theoretically, the perfect child could be conceived of the perfect match.
..* in Plato's ideal, the *guardians* would only breed with *guardians* ensuring a purity of the higher "caste", to create the perfect society.

** A nice instance of theoretical eugenics. any discussion of genetics seems to always open the door for people to theorise as to the creation of perfect children, and, by extension, the perfect society. **

* Aristotle decided to take this apart. His early use of the scientific method rightly showed that inheritance was mixed between male and female animals. features of both were present in the offspring.
..* he even noted that some features skipped generations.
..* his final attack on Pythagoras' logic was that the "traveling library" theory quite simply couldn't account for female anatomy.

At this point, hereditary theory developed to account for the joint creation by the male and the female. A passing of information from both bodies, combined to create an offspring.

The essence, was the transmission of information.

> Message became material.

Our first glimpse at a concept which would later become DNA. However, hereditary science would develop no further from Aristotle until Mendel. Centuries of non-development.

In 1831, Darwn, reading Sir John Herschel's theory of how biological phenomena would eventually be reduced to cause and effect mechanisms, to pure chemistry, stumbled across an interesting question.

Herschel had asked two interesting questions:
1. How did life come to be
2. Once it comes to be, how does diversity occur. How do things change - this is the "mystery of mysteries".

It is this second question that Darwin sought to answer. His capacity of viewing nature, not as a static fact to be observed (and therefore, classified in taxonomies), but as an constantly evolving process.

And so, Mendel asked the micro question: how does a single organism transmit information over a single generation. 

And Darwin asked the macro question: how do organisms transmute information over thousands of generations.

However, a major block would present itself to the development of a cogent theory: Religion.

The bible places God at the centre of creation. As Darwin collected his data and began writing, he stumbled across natural and generational variation (this phenomena - that plants and animals occasionally produce offspring with features different from the parents - had been known to him and farmers of generations, after all, that is what selective breeding is all about. But the leap from there, to a codified theory would quickly lead one down the road to blasphemy). Darwin ended up pondering what *hand* had guided this evolution in traits over generations.

He found his answers in works by Reverend Thomas Malthus. Malthus had reasoned that the human population was in a constant struggle against its environment and that when the population outgrew its environment, some sort of culling would occur: a plague due to population density, or a famine due to lack of resources. Those that survived this natural selection (the fittest), would then go on and start reproducing again, thereby creating a cycle.

Death, Darwin realised, was the hand guiding evolution. Nature selected the fittest, and they in turn reproduced. The question remained, however, as to the mechanism for inheritance. Here, Darwin's shortcomings as a biologist came to fore. He stuck with the Aristotelian theory of information transmission, using a more recent notion of *gemmules* which captured information from all the bodies organs, and passed them on as a reproductive blueprint: *Pangenesis*, he would call it.

The main issue with this theory (and all those preceding it) were mathematic. As pointed out by Fleeming Jenkin, if hereditary information was simply a blending of two gemmules, or information modules, then any new variation would simply be bred out by interbreeding. Any peculiarity would be washed out over generations. Nothing would protect the fittest genes from being washed out.

The answer to this problem, brings us back to Mendel in Brno. Mendel was experimenting with peas. He planted a crop and observe its characteristics, noting that they tended to come in pairs: Smooth or wrinkled seeds; white or violet flowers; tall or short plants etc. The first cataloging of the concept of alleles. He then started to breed hybrids of pure breeds, and writing down all the possible variations and combinations of features.

By studying the ratios between different progenies produced by cross breeding, Mendel began creating a model explaining the inheritance of traits.

Mendel realised that heredity could only be explained by information passing from *both* parents. The offspring would manifest the visual traits of the *dominant* allele, but *both* alleles were preserved, and passed on - thereby allowing for recessive genes to reappear and skip generations.

in 1900, three papers cited Mendel's, after decades of silence, "rediscovering" what he had wrote. One, written by Hugo de Vries, took Mendel's experiments further, asking the question *how did variants arise in the first place*? After much observation, de Vries noted that these variants occurred spontaneously, and therefore named them **mutants**, signifying their change.

> if you coupled the genesis of spontaneous mutants... with natural selection, then Darwin's relentless engine was automatically set in motion.

in the same year, 1900, William Bateson learned of Mendel's work and was enamoured. He would go on to proselytise around Europe, making sure Mendel's work would never be forgotten. As students gathered around him to study inheritance, Bateson realised he needed a name for this new discipline. Pangenetics was a loaded term, carrying the baggage of Darwin's mistakes. And so, in 1905 Bateson coined a new word: **Genetics** - the study of heredity and variation.

He later wrote:
> what will happen when... enlightenment actually comes to pass and the facts of heredity are... commonly known? One thing is certain: mankind will begin to interfere... in some country more ready to break with the past and eager for 'national efficiency'... the science of heredity will soon provide power on a stupendous scale... that power will be applied to control the composition of a nation.
